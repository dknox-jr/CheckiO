# Challenge:

# In computer science and discrete mathematics, an inversion is a pair of places in a sequence
# where the elements in these places are out of their natural order.
# So, if we use ascending order for a group of numbers, then an inversion is when
# larger numbers appear before lower number in a sequence.
# Check out this example sequence: (1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6) and we can see here three inversions
# - 5 and 3; - 5 and 4; - 7 and 6.
# You are given a sequence of unique numbers and you should count the number of inversions in this sequence.
# Input: A sequence as a tuple of integers.
# Output: The inversion number as an integer.
# Precondition: 2 < len(sequence) < 200
# len(sequence) == len(set(sequence))
# all(-100 < x < 100 for x in sequence)

# My Solution:


def count_inversion(sequence):
    """
        Count inversions in a sequence of numbers
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(sequence)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(sequence)):
            if sequence[i] > sequence[j]:
                count += 1
            
    return count

if __name__ == '__main__':
    #These "asserts" using only for self-checking and not necessary for auto-testing
    assert count_inversion((1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6)) == 3, "Example"
    assert count_inversion((0, 1, 2, 3)) == 0, "Sorted"
    assert count_inversion((99, -99)) == 1, "Two numbers"
