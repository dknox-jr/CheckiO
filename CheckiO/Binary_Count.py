# Challenge:

# For the Robots the decimal format is inconvenient. If they need to count to "1",
# their computer brains want to count it in the binary representation of that number.
# You are given a number (a positive integer).
# You should convert it to the binary format and count how many unities (1) are in the number spelling.
# For example: 5 = 0b101 contains two unities, so the answer is 2.
# Input: A number as a positive integer.
# Output: The quantity of unities in the binary form as an integer.
# Precondition: 0 < number â‰¤ 232

# My Solution:


def checkio(number):
    count = 0
    for i in list(str(bin(number))):
        if i == '1':
            count += 1
    return count


#These "asserts" using only for self-checking and not necessary for auto-testing
if __name__ == '__main__':
    assert checkio(4) == 1
    assert checkio(15) == 4
    assert checkio(1) == 1
    assert checkio(1022) == 9
